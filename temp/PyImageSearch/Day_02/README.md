Hi,

Yesterday, you saw that this course is less about theory and more about creating computer vision apps that are actually useful, practical, and hands-on.

Why spend hours reading about what you can do with computer vision and deep learning? Wouldn’t it be more fun to actually start doing everything?

I think so.

Which is why I’ve put together a boot camp that will walk you through the fundamentals of image processing using the OpenCV library — with plenty of hands-on examples for you to try.

By the time you complete today's lesson, you'll understand the basics of image processing using OpenCV, the world's most popular computer vision library (and one we'll leverage quite extensively in the rest of this crash course). And you'll be able to see for yourself how powerful the library is.

Grab yourself a drink (hydration is important!), and let’s dive into the OpenCV Boot Camp.

Oh, and by the way, tomorrow you’ll be creating your very first app in OpenCV, so don’t miss that email.
