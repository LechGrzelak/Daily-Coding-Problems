Hi,

Welcome to the 17-day computer vision and deep learning crash course. Catchy name, right?

Seriously, thank you for signing up — you’ve taken the first step towards mastering computer vision, OpenCV, and deep learning, which is fantastic.

As you might have already determined — you strike me as a pretty smart person — this crash course is 17 days long. Each day for 17 days (Monday-Friday), you’ll receive an email with a new lesson based on the tutorials I’ve written on my blog, PyImageSearch, over the last 5 years.

This course organizes those tutorials into a cohesive program designed to get you working in computer vision and deep learning FAST.

You’ll learn a lot over the next 2.5 weeks, and you’re also going to get your hands dirty, digging into the code and building real computer vision projects. The thing is, computer vision and deep learning are a lot of fun — when you approach them the right way.

In other words, this course is not about hours of monotonous study or doing boring, tedious homework. It’s about getting hands-on with CV and DL and using them to solve real-world problems. You get a practical education and you get to have fun along the way.

As proof of this, today, you’ll get a close-up look at the "hidden" deep learning-based face detector that most people don't know is built right into OpenCV:

We’re starting here for a few reasons:
Come on. Discovering hidden stuff is just plain COOL. You’re going to know something that a lot of CV/DL practitioners don’t, which is fun.
You can use face detection in images and video, which makes it seriously useful.
The hidden face detector is a pre-trained model that’s shipped with the OpenCV library, so you can dig in even if you don’t know a lot about OpenCV yet.
To learn more about where you can find this little-known feature of OpenCV and see exactly how to set it up and use it for highly accurate face detection — even in low light and poor resolution conditions — head on over to today’s lesson.

Most lessons will take you about 10-20 minutes to complete — and they’re all designed to give you the practical skills you need to use a particular computer vision or deep learning technique with confidence. This can translate directly into better job opportunities, higher salaries, and exciting opportunities to develop all kinds of amazing tools.

By setting aside the 10-20 minutes to complete each day’s lesson, you’re truly investing in your future.

Remember the first time you thought about getting into computer programming? I bet it wasn't because someone showed you a screenful of code...

Instead, your motivation was likely more practical, real-world, and tangible.

Maybe you wanted to understand how websites were created so you could build your own. Perhaps you read an article about the creator of the Flappy Bird game was making $50,000/day off his app and you wanted to do the same. Or maybe you started coding because you saw how computer vision is helping medical professionals diagnose health problems earlier than ever — or something else entirely, that made you want to be a part of that world.

That’s what this crash course is for. To help you get back the excitement that goes along with learning new skills and using those skills to create real-world solutions.

I’m excited that you’re here. Let’s get started!

I'll be back tomorrow with the second lesson in the crash course.
