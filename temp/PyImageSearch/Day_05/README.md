Hi!

You’ve probably noticed by now that I like to have fun building practical, real-world computer vision projects here at PyImageSearch.

The way I see it is this:

If you’re going to spend hours, days, weeks, and years of your life learning new skills, you may as well make sure that the skills you’re learning are useful — and that you enjoy what you’re doing, right?

Perhaps the coolest thing about computer vision and deep learning techniques is that they are already making a real difference in the world. And if you can learn everything you need to know while creating real-world solutions and having fun? That’s the best of all worlds.

Today, we’re going to continue this theme of having fun by playing a little ball:

Actually, we’re going to track a ball in a video stream, using Python, OpenCV color-based threshold.

And of course, the techniques you’ll learn here will let you track other objects in video streams, too.

This super-simple object tracker can identify and track a ball that is partially obscured and occluded by my hand.

Not bad for 20 minutes of work that feels like play.

By the time you finish today’s tutorial, you’ll have a clear understanding of simple, color-based object tracking — and you’ll build your very own object tracker.

P.S. If you're feeling brave, I have a more advanced object tracker that combines object tracking with face detection from our lesson of Day 1 in the crash course. You can check it out here.

P.P.S. You’ve probably already figured out that these are the very same techniques used in real-time detection and tracking systems — like traffic cameras and license plate trackers. Yep, once you master the fundamentals, you’ll be able to do all kinds of amazing things!
