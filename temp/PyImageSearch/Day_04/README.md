Hi,

If you saw yesterday’s crash course email on building a document scanner, I think you’re going to like this...

You’ve already seen how you can use computer vision effectively to scan documents, but why stop there?

Wouldn’t it be more useful if you could actually do something with the information you scanned?

For example, remember those “achievement tests” back in elementary school? How about the SATs, ACTs, AP exams, and all the rest of the standardized tests you had to go through to get to where you are today? Does the sight of a No. 2 pencil still make you shudder?

Knowing that your entire future rests on the circles you fill in during two hours of testing, trying to remember strategies for when you don’t know the answer to a question (Always choose C? Never choose C? Skip it? Never skip it? ) — okay, I may have a bit of residual testing anxiety.

And did you ever even give any thought to how these exams were actually graded?

You probably wouldn’t want to grade all those exams by hand. Instead, you’d want to build a system that can automatically grade the exams. But how do you go about building such a system? And is it possible to create such a system using computer vision?

We’re going to start with the techniques we covered in yesterday’s document scanner lesson and add some new techniques to create a functional bubble sheet scanner and test grader.

Just think about the number of exams students take just in the United States every year. There’s a massive market out there just clamoring for solutions to the hundreds — even thousands — of hours spent grading standardized tests.

If you want a piece of that market one day, this tutorial is your starting point.

These simple and straightforward computer vision techniques have extensive real-world applications. By mastering these techniques now, you’ll be poised to provide the kind of solutions companies are willing to pay quite well for.
