This problem was asked by Google.

Given the root of a binary tree, return a deepest node. For example, in the following tree, return d.

```
    a
   / \
  b   c
 /
d
```

The solution successfully finds the deepest node and we use a [library](https://github.com/jdmcpeek/pretty-print-binary-tree) to visualize the tree:
```
__73__
/     \
40      80
     / \
   76  95

depth= 3
Deepest Node = 76
```
